            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet.<br>
             It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather<br>
              than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites <br>
              for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet<br> 
              browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
