        <p>
             
            My Self Istiyak Khan I've been trained on a wide range of internet text to generate responses to various prompts and questions.
             I'm designed to assist with providing information, answering queries, and engaging in conversations on a wide 
             range of topics. However, please keep in mind that I don't have personal experiences or emotions as humans do.
              Is there anything specific you'd like to know or discuss?
